SELECT * FROM `follow_church` WHERE ((`follower_id`=203 or `blesser_id`=203 or `favourite_id`=203) or (`follower_id`=0 and `blesser_id`=0 and `favourite_id`=0)) && `church_owner_id`=49

WHERE   EXISTS
        ( 
            SELECT  203 
            FROM    follow_church  b
            WHERE   b.follower_id = '203' AND 
                    a.follower_id IN (blesser_id, favourite_id)
        )

SELECT * 
    CASE WHEN follower_id = '203' THEN 'He is Follower of this Church'
	     WHEN blesser_id = '203' THEN 'He is Blesser of this Church'	
         WHEN favourite_id = '203' THEN 'He is Favourite of this Church'
